#Autoencoder Demo With tensorflow - MNIST data

Overview
============

This code demos a simple autoencoder that is able to generate handwritten digit images after training against the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.


Basic Usage
===========

Once you've downloaded the repository simply type the following into terminal

`python main.py`

The autoencoder will automatically start downloading the MNIST dataset, then training on it. When finished, it'll be able to generate it's own images.
